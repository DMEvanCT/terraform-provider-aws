```release-note:note
resource/aws_redshift_cluster: The `snapshot_copy` argument is now deprecated. Use the `aws_redshift_snapshot_copy` resource instead. Until this argument is removed in the next major version, an `ignore_changes` lifecycle configuration will be required on the cluster to prevent persistent differences when using the new standlone resource.
